## students table for example
``` sql
create table students(
    id int,
    name varchar(50),
    marks int not null,
    grade varchar(5),
    city varchar(20),
    primary key(id)
);

INSERT INTO students
(id, name, marks, grade, city)
VALUES
(101, 'anil', 78, 'C', 'Pune'),
(102, 'bhumika', 93, 'A', 'Mumbai'),
(103, 'chetan', 85, 'B', 'Mumbai'),
(104, 'dhruv', 96, 'A', 'Delhi'),
(105, 'emanuel', 12, 'F', 'Delhi'),
(106, 'farah', 82, 'B', 'Delhi');
```

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is `SELECT`?
* It is used to **fetch data** from database tables.
* You specify **which columns** you want to retrieve.
* You can also **filter, sort, group, and limit** the data using other clauses.

---
## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```
---
## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Examples:

### a) Select all columns from the table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM students;
```
* `*` means **all columns**.

---

### b) Select specific columns:

```sql
SELECT id, name, marks
FROM students;
```
* Only these three columns will be retrieved.

---
## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Using `DISTINCT`:

* To get **unique** rows (remove duplicates).

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM students;
```
---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Aliases:

* Rename columns or tables for clarity in results (output).
```sql
SELECT name AS student_name, marks AS student_marks
FROM students;
```

You're doing great! Your notes on `SELECT` already cover the **core concepts** very well. However, if your goal is to be **fully confident and exam-proof**, here are a few **additional deep concepts** worth adding to make it truly **complete**:

### üîπ 6Ô∏è‚É£ `SELECT` with Expressions or Calculations:

Can perform calculations directly in the `SELECT` clause.

```sql
SELECT name, marks, marks + 10 AS bonus_marks
FROM students;
```
> Adds 10 to each student's marks.
Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Description         | Example                            |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition            | `SELECT marks + 5 FROM students;`  |
| `-`      | Subtraction         | `SELECT marks - 5 FROM students;`  |
| `*`      | Multiplication      | `SELECT marks * 2 FROM students;`  |
| `/`      | Division            | `SELECT marks / 2 FROM students;`  |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder) | `SELECT marks % 10 FROM students;` |

### üîπ 7Ô∏è‚É£ `SELECT` with Functions (built-in):

SQL provides functions we can use inside `SELECT`:

| Type      | Examples                                           |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Text      | `UPPER()`, `LOWER()`, `LENGTH()`                   |
| Numeric   | `ROUND()`, `CEIL()`, `FLOOR()`                     |
| Date/Time | `NOW()`, `CURDATE()`, `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`          |
| Aggregate | `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `SUM()` ‚Äì used with `GROUP BY` |

```sql
SELECT UPPER(name) AS upper_name
FROM students;
```
```sql
SELECT name, LENGTH(name) AS name_length
FROM students;
```

```sql
select count(id) as total_id
from students;
```
---

### üîπ 8Ô∏è‚É£ Using `SELECT` without `FROM` (Yes, it‚Äôs possible!)

This is for testing expressions or constants.

```sql
SELECT 2 + 2;
-- Output: 4
```

Or:

```sql
SELECT NOW();
-- Output: 2025-09-17 03:45:21
Current date & time
```
Great for quick calculations or function testing.

### üîπ 9Ô∏è‚É£ Nested `SELECT` (Subqueries)

You can use `SELECT` inside another `SELECT`.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM students
WHERE marks = (SELECT MAX(marks) FROM students);
```

> Returns the student(s) with the highest marks.

This is called a **scalar subquery** (returns one value).

---

### üîπ üîü `SELECT` with Conditions (Combined with `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, etc.)

```sql
SELECT name, marks
FROM students
WHERE marks > 80
ORDER BY marks DESC;
```

> Shows names and marks of students who scored more than 80, sorted high to low.

---

## üß† Bonus Pro Tip:

You can also use `CASE` in `SELECT` for conditional output:

```sql
SELECT name, marks,
  CASE
    WHEN marks >= 90 THEN 'Excellent'
    WHEN marks >= 75 THEN 'Good'
    ELSE 'Needs Improvement'
  END AS performance
FROM students;
```

> Adds a custom column called `performance` based on `marks`.

## Cobining `SELECT` with other clauses:

* `WHERE` ‚Äî filter rows
* `GROUP BY` ‚Äî group rows
* `HAVING` ‚Äî filter groups
* `ORDER BY` ‚Äî sort results
* `LIMIT` / `OFFSET` ‚Äî restrict number of rows

---

## Full example:

```sql
SELECT city, AVG(marks) AS average_marks
FROM students
WHERE marks > 50
GROUP BY city
HAVING AVG(marks) > 75
ORDER BY average_marks DESC
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 0;
```

* Select cities with students scoring > 50
* Group students by city
* Only include cities with avg marks > 75
* Sort descending by average marks
* Return first 5 results

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Notes:

* You **must** have `FROM` clause.
* You **cannot** select columns without grouping them if using `GROUP BY` (unless they are aggregated).
* Use functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()` to aggregate data.
