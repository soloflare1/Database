### students table for example
``` sql
create table students(
    id int,
    name varchar(50),
    marks int not null,
    grade varchar(5),
    city varchar(20),
    primary key(id)
);

INSERT INTO students
(id, name, marks, grade, city)
VALUES
(101, 'anil', 78, 'C', 'Pune'),
(102, 'bhumika', 93, 'A', 'Mumbai'),
(103, 'chetan', 85, 'B', 'Mumbai'),
(104, 'dhruv', 96, 'A', 'Delhi'),
(105, 'emanuel', 12, 'F', 'Delhi'),
(106, 'farah', 82, 'B', 'Delhi');

## ‚úÖ 1. `SELECT`üîé ‚Äî **What to display**
## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is `SELECT`?
* It is used to **fetch data** from database tables.
* You specify **which columns** you want to retrieve.
* You can also **filter, sort, group, and limit** the data using other clauses.

---
## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```
---
## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Examples:

### a) Select all columns from the table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM students;
```
* `*` means **all columns**.

---

### b) Select specific columns:

```sql
SELECT id, name, marks
FROM students;
```
* Only these three columns will be retrieved.

---
## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Using `DISTINCT`:

* To get **unique** rows (remove duplicates).

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM students;
```
---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Aliases:

* Rename columns or tables for clarity in results (output).
```sql
SELECT name AS student_name, marks AS student_marks
FROM students;
```

---
You're doing great! Your notes on `SELECT` already cover the **core concepts** very well. However, if your goal is to be **fully confident and exam-proof**, here are a few **additional deep concepts** worth adding to make it truly **complete**:

---

### üîπ 6Ô∏è‚É£ `SELECT` with Expressions or Calculations:

Can perform calculations directly in the `SELECT` clause.

```sql
SELECT name, marks, marks + 10 AS bonus_marks
FROM students;
```
> Adds 10 to each student's marks.

---
### üîπ 7Ô∏è‚É£ `SELECT` with Functions (built-in):

SQL provides functions we can use inside `SELECT`:

| Type      | Examples                                           |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Text      | `UPPER()`, `LOWER()`, `LENGTH()`                   |
| Numeric   | `ROUND()`, `CEIL()`, `FLOOR()`                     |
| Date/Time | `NOW()`, `CURDATE()`, `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`          |
| Aggregate | `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `SUM()` ‚Äì used with `GROUP BY` |

```sql
SELECT UPPER(name) AS upper_name
FROM students;
```
```sql
SELECT name, LENGTH(name) AS name_length
FROM students;
```

```sql
select count(id) as total_id
from students;
```
---

### üîπ 8Ô∏è‚É£ Using `SELECT` without `FROM` (Yes, it‚Äôs possible!)

This is for testing expressions or constants.

```sql
SELECT 2 + 2;
-- Output: 4
```

Or:

```sql
SELECT NOW();
-- Output: 2025-09-17 03:45:21
Current date & time
```
Great for quick calculations or function testing.

---

### üîπ 9Ô∏è‚É£ Nested `SELECT` (Subqueries)

You can use `SELECT` inside another `SELECT`.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM students
WHERE marks = (SELECT MAX(marks) FROM students);
```

> Returns the student(s) with the highest marks.

This is called a **scalar subquery** (returns one value).

---

### üîπ üîü `SELECT` with Conditions (Combined with `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, etc.)

```sql
SELECT name, marks
FROM students
WHERE marks > 80
ORDER BY marks DESC;
```

> Shows names and marks of students who scored more than 80, sorted high to low.

---

## üß† Bonus Pro Tip:

You can also use `CASE` in `SELECT` for conditional output:

```sql
SELECT name, marks,
  CASE
    WHEN marks >= 90 THEN 'Excellent'
    WHEN marks >= 75 THEN 'Good'
    ELSE 'Needs Improvement'
  END AS performance
FROM students;
```

> Adds a custom column called `performance` based on `marks`.

| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ          | Basic `SELECT` syntax                   |
| ‚úÖ          | Selecting specific columns              |
| ‚úÖ          | `SELECT *`                              |

| ‚úÖ          | `SELECT` without `FROM` (optional)      |
| ‚úÖ          | Combining with `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, etc |

---

## Cobining `SELECT` with other clauses:

* `WHERE` ‚Äî filter rows
* `GROUP BY` ‚Äî group rows
* `HAVING` ‚Äî filter groups
* `ORDER BY` ‚Äî sort results
* `LIMIT` / `OFFSET` ‚Äî restrict number of rows

---

## Full example:

```sql
SELECT city, AVG(marks) AS average_marks
FROM students
WHERE marks > 50
GROUP BY city
HAVING AVG(marks) > 75
ORDER BY average_marks DESC
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 0;
```

* Select cities with students scoring > 50
* Group students by city
* Only include cities with avg marks > 75
* Sort descending by average marks
* Return first 5 results

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Notes:

* You **must** have `FROM` clause.
* You **cannot** select columns without grouping them if using `GROUP BY` (unless they are aggregated).
* Use functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()` to aggregate data.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. `WHERE` ‚Äî **Row filtration (records)**

### Purpose:

* Filters rows before grouping or displaying results or aggregation occurring.

### Syntax:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE marks > 80;
```

### Operators:
Absolutely! Here's a **complete guide to all common SQL operators** ‚Äî covering **Arithmetic**, **Comparison**, **Logical**, **Bitwise**, and some **Special operators** like `LIKE`, `IN`, `IS NULL`. This will give you a **full picture** of operators used in SQL queries.

# üìù Summary Table of Common Operators:

| Category   | Operators                                                                 | Description                                |                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Arithmetic | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`                                                   | Basic math operations                      |                         |
| Comparison | `=`, `!=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `LIKE`, `IS NULL` | Compare values and patterns                |                         |
| Logical    | `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`                                                        | Combine or negate conditions               |                         |
| Bitwise    | `&`, \`                                                                   | `, `^`, `\~`, `<<`, `>>\`                  | Binary bit manipulation |
| Special    | `EXISTS`, `ANY`, `ALL`, `CAST()`, `CASE`                                  | Subqueries, typecasting, conditional logic |                         |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:

* `LIKE` operator is **case-insensitive** or **case-sensitive** depending on DBMS.
* Use `IS NULL` to check null values, **not** `= NULL`.
* `BETWEEN` is inclusive.
* `IN` is easier than writing many `OR`s.
* Logical operators combine multiple conditions ‚Äî order matters, use parentheses for clarity.

### To filter aggregated data, use the HAVING clause instead.
No worries! Let me explain that clearly with a simple example.

---

### Understanding `WHERE` vs `HAVING` in SQL

---

### 1. **WHERE** filters **rows before grouping**

* Think of **WHERE** as a filter that decides **which rows** go into the grouping step.
* It **cannot use aggregate functions** like `AVG()`, `SUM()`, because those need groups to exist first.

---

### 2. **HAVING** filters **after grouping**

* Once the rows are grouped, **HAVING** filters the **groups** based on aggregate calculations.
* So, you use `HAVING` when you want to filter based on **aggregated results**.

---

### Example:

Suppose you want to find cities where the **average marks of students is greater than 80**.

You **cannot** write this (invalid SQL):

```sql
SELECT city, AVG(marks) 
FROM students
WHERE AVG(marks) > 80    -- ‚ùå ERROR: can't use AVG here
GROUP BY city;
```

Why? Because `AVG(marks)` needs the data to be grouped first to calculate the average.

---

### Correct way ‚Äî use `HAVING`:

```sql
SELECT city, AVG(marks) AS avg_marks
FROM students
GROUP BY city
HAVING AVG(marks) > 80;    -- ‚úÖ This filters groups after grouping
```

* Here, `GROUP BY city` groups the students by city.
* `AVG(marks)` calculates average marks per city.
* `HAVING` filters to only those cities where average marks > 80.

---

### Summary:

| Clause   | What it filters                   | Can it use aggregates? |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `WHERE`  | Filters individual **rows**       | ‚ùå No                   |
| `HAVING` | Filters **groups** after grouping | ‚úÖ Yes                  |


---

## ‚úÖ 3. `GROUP BY` ‚Äî **Group similar rows**

### ???? Purpose:

* It collects rows into groups on the basis of one or more columns, so we can apply **aggregate functions** on each group.

### ???? Syntax:
```sql
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM students GROUP BY city;
```

### ???? Why:

* You need **summary information**, for instance:

  * Number of students per city
  * Average marks per grade
  * Highest marks per city

### ???? Supported Aggregates:

* `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`

### ???? Notes:

* All columns selected in the SELECT statement **must be grouped or aggregated**.

### ???? Common Error:

```sql
SELECT name, COUNT(*) FROM students GROUP BY city; ‚ùå
```

> `name` is neither grouped nor aggregated ‚Üí SQL error.

---

## ‚úÖ 4. `HAVING` ‚Äî **Filter groups (not rows)**

### üîπ Purpose:

* `HAVING` filters **groups** created by `GROUP BY`.

### üîπ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM students
GROUP BY city
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### üîπ Why:

* You want only the groups that meet a condition:

  * Cities with more than 2 students
  * Grades where average marks are over 80

### üîπ Key Difference:

| Clause | Filters What? |
| ------ | ------------- |
| WHERE  | Rows          |
| HAVING | Groups        |

### üîπ Common Mistake:

```sql
SELECT city FROM students HAVING marks > 90; ‚ùå
```

> Use `WHERE` if you're not grouping.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. `ORDER BY` ‚Äî **Sort the output**

### üîπ Purpose:

* To **sort rows** by one or more columns, in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.

### üîπ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY marks DESC;
```

### üîπ Why:

* Show top performers, oldest users, latest transactions, etc.

### üîπ Notes:

* Default is `ASC` (A-Z or smallest to largest).
* Can sort by multiple columns:

```sql
ORDER BY grade ASC, marks DESC;
```

---

## ‚úÖ 6. `LIMIT` ‚Äî **Limit the number of rows**

### üîπ Purpose:

* Restrict the number of rows in result ‚Äî useful in **pagination** or top-N queries.

### üîπ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students LIMIT 3;
```

### üîπ Why:

* For performance (especially on large datasets).
* Show only top 5 records, or preview small sets.

### üîπ Notes:

* Works **after all filtering and ordering** is done.

---

## ‚úÖ 7. `OFFSET` ‚Äî **Skip rows**

### üîπ Purpose:

* Skips a number of rows **before** returning the `LIMIT`ed results.

### üîπ Syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY marks DESC LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2;
```

### üîπ Why:

* Used in **pagination**, e.g., "Show next 5 results".

### üîπ Example:

If you have this ordering:

| Name    | Marks |
| ------- | ----- |
| Dhruv   | 96    |
| Bhumika | 93    |
| Chetan  | 85    |
| Farah   | 82    |
| Anil    | 78    |
| Emanuel | 12    |

Then:

```sql
LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2
```

‚û°Ô∏è Returns: Chetan, Farah, Anil

---

## üîÅ How They Work Together ‚Äì Execution Order

| Step | Clause         | Purpose                                     |
| ---- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£  | `FROM`         | Get data from table                         |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£  | `WHERE`        | Filter rows                                 |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£  | `GROUP BY`     | Group the filtered rows                     |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£  | `HAVING`       | Filter the grouped results                  |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£  | `SELECT`       | Pick columns or expressions                 |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£  | `ORDER BY`     | Sort the final result                       |
| 7Ô∏è‚É£  | `LIMIT/OFFSET` | Return specific number of rows (pagination) |

---

## ‚úÖ Example 

**Q: Show top 2 cities (that have more than 1 student), based on average marks of students, in descending order**

```sql
SELECT city, AVG(marks) AS avg_marks, COUNT(*) AS student_count
FROM students
WHERE marks > 50
GROUP BY city
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY avg_marks DESC
LIMIT 2;
```

### ‚úÖ Explanation:

* `WHERE marks > 50` ‚Üí keep students with >50 marks
* `GROUP BY city` ‚Üí group by city
* `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1` ‚Üí keep only cities with more than 1 such student
* `ORDER BY avg_marks DESC` ‚Üí sort by average marks
* `LIMIT 2` ‚Üí show top 2 cities
