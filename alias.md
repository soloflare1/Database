### 🔁 Execution Order :

```txt
1. FROM
2. WHERE         -- ❌ alias not available
3. GROUP BY
4. HAVING        -- ⚠️ alias sometimes available (e.g., MySQL)
5. SELECT        -- ✅ alias defined here
6. ORDER BY      -- ✅ alias can be used here
```

## 🧠 Summary: Can I use aliases?

| Clause     | Can Use Alias? | Why / Notes                                 |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `WHERE`    | ❌ No           | Happens before alias is created             |
| `HAVING`   | ⚠️ Maybe       | Depends on SQL engine — not always reliable |
| `SELECT`   | ✅ Yes          | Thes after `SELECT`, so alias is available |

---

### ⚠️ Best Practice:

✅ Always use **full expressions** (like `marks + 5`, `COUNT(*)`) inside `WHERE` and `HAVING` for **maximum compatibility** across databases.



## ✅ So — is `HAVING` the same as `WHERE` in this case?

> **Almost — but slightly different!**

---

## 🔍 In Detail:

### 1️⃣ `WHERE` — ❌ Alias doesn't work

Because aliases are created in `SELECT`, and `WHERE` runs **before** that, the alias doesn’t exist yet.

✅ So this works:

```sql
WHERE marks + 5 > 90
```

❌ But this fails:

```sql
WHERE bonus_marks > 90
```

---

### 2️⃣ `HAVING` — ⚠️ Alias **may** work, but not guaranteed

Different SQL databases handle this **differently**:

| DBMS       | `HAVING` can use alias? |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| MySQL      | ✅ Yes                   |
| PostgreSQL | ❌ No (usually)          |
| SQLite     | ✅ Yes                   |
| Oracle     | ⚠️ Sometimes            |
| SQL Server | ⚠️ Sometimes            |

So:

```sql
SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM students
GROUP BY city
HAVING total > 2;  -- ✅ Works in MySQL, SQLite
```

But safer across all systems:

```sql
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2   -- ✅ Always works
```

---

### ✅ Best Practice:

> Even if alias **might** work in `HAVING`, **always prefer the full expression** (like `COUNT(*)`) to stay portable and clear.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

* `HAVING` is **not exactly the same** as `WHERE` regarding aliases.
* `HAVING` **can sometimes** use them, depending on the SQL engine.
* But for **portability and safety**, write the full expression.
